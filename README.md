# Capstone-Project---4---Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, the task is to indentify major customer segments on a traditional data set which contains all the transaction occuring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store retail.

Project is performed in following steps

Basic EDA on Dataset - This step involves exploring data set and checking relationship between variables and checking their distributions.

RFM Analysis - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups.

RECENCY (R): Days since last purchase
FREQUENCY (F): Total number of purchases
MONETARY VALUE (M): Total money this customer spent.
Visualization Using different Charts - This step involves creating various charts and graphs to visualize the data and identify the patterns and relationships among the features. Some of the charts that can be used are bar charts, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.

Hypothesis Testing - This step involves testing some hypotheses or assumptions about the data using statistical methods.

Feature Engineering for clustering - This step involves creating new features or transforming existing features to make them suitable for clustering.

Clustering analysis using k-means and agglomerative - This step involves applying k-means and agglomerative clustering algorithms to group the customers based on their RFM score. This step can help to identify the optimal segments of customers.
